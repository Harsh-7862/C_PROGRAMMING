// polymorphism-> C++ is when the behavior of the same object or function is different in different contexts.
// 1.static compile time -> a.function/ method overloading. -> b. operator overloading. ->c. constructor overloading
// 2.Dynamic runtime polymorphism.
// COMPILE-TIME	
// Compile-time polymorphism is also known as static or early binding polymorphism.	
// The function calls are resolved by the compiler.	
 
//   RUN-TIME
// Run-time polymorphism is also known as dynamic or late binding polymorphism.
// The function calls are not resolved by the compiler.
